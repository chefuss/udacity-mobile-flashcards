# Flash cards - mobile app
Final project for the react nanodegree.

## Description
Our main objective is to build a mobile app (Android and IOS). The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Requirements
1. Use create-react-native-app to build your project.
2. Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
3. Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
4. The front of the card should display the question.
5. The back of the card should display the answer.
6. Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
7. Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.

## Installation
In order to run the app you need to have installed:
1. Expo
2. nodejs
3. npm

run
```yarn install```
```yarn start```
